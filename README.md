# Man-in-the-Middle Detection

This project implements a detection system for **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks** in critical network infrastructure using an **Improved Artificial Rabbit Optimization (ARO) algorithm** in MATLAB. The project focuses on feature selection and classification to improve detection accuracy.

## Project Structure


## Features

- **Dataset preprocessing**: Prepares the data for analysis.  
- **Feature selection**: Uses the Improved Artificial Rabbit Optimization (ARO) algorithm to select the most relevant features.  
- **Attack classification**: Employs a Decision Tree (DT) classifier to detect MITM attacks.  
- **Easy to run**: Fully implemented in MATLAB; requires no additional libraries.

## How to Run

1. Open MATLAB.  
2. Set the working directory to this project folder.  
3. Open `main_code.m` and run the script.  
4. The script will preprocess the dataset, perform feature selection, and output detection results.

## Dataset

- `dataset.csv` contains a sample dataset used for experiments.  
- You can replace it with your own dataset if desired, but ensure the format matches.
